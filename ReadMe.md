# Workout Notion Data Pooler

This grabs data from my workouts (each in its own page, many tables) into a few large tables to use with NotionCharts.

## Motivation

This automates a specific task that I have for my Notion account; this exists as a public repo simply for any recruiter to see my competency.

The following paragraph describes its purpose and motivation.

The easiest way for me to track my workouts is to use one page per workout, and one table per exercise such that every page has several tables.
To use NotionCharts (one of many online tools for creating graphs and charts with Notion tables), all data to be charted must be in the same table.
Therefore, to graph data of a given exercise over all workouts, this data must be copied into one large table.
This *could* be done by myself at the end of each week, probably within 10 to 20 minutes, but as a busy student and upcoming career engineer, I would much rather automate the process.
